# Risk Game Engine
This repository contains Logic and Function's modified version of the Risk game engine for SYNCS Bot Battle 2024. The original version was only designed for Linux and MacOS, but this one should (probably?) work on Windows (plus Git Bash).

# Installation for Freaks
1. Run `./setup_env.sh` in Git Bash.
2. Activate the Python virtual environment using `source ./.venv/Scripts/activate` in Git Bash.
3. Simulating matches should be the same as usual. On my system, I was unable to use `python3` in the virtual environment. If you get missing module errors, try using `python`.
